            "NIIGATA, JAPAN: Political brinkmanship over raising the US debt ceiling risks “serious economic costs” even without the “catastrophe” of a default, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Thursday at G7 finance talks in Japan. Hours earlier, former president Donald Trump urged Republican legislators to trigger the first-ever US debt default by refusing to lift the limit if Democrats do not agree to spending cuts. President Joe Biden has also threatened to call off his trip to Asia, including in-person attendance at next weekend’s Group of Seven summit, if the deepening standoff is not resolved soon. US debt standoff overshadows G7 finance leaders’ meeting “In my assessment – and that of economists across the board – a default on US obligations would produce an economic and financial catastrophe,” Yellen said in a speech. “Short of a default, brinkmanship over the debt limit can also impose serious economic costs,” she added as a three-day meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs began in the city of Niigata. The lifting of the so-called debt ceiling – a limit on government borrowing to pay for bills already incurred – is often routine. US govt credit default swaps hit all time high on debt ceiling impasse But budget-minded Republicans, who won control of the House of Representatives in 2022, have vowed to only raise the limit from its current $31.4 trillion maximum if spending curbs are enacted. Last week Yellen warned that the United States could run out of money to meet its financial obligations as early as June 1. On Thursday she recalled a similar impasse in 2011, which resulted in the United States losing its coveted AAA debt rating. “There is no good reason to generate a crisis of our own making,” Yellen said. “The US Congress has raised or suspended the debt limit almost 80 times since 1960. I urge it to act quickly to do so once again.” Biden, McCarthy start US debt ceiling talks as clock ticks to default A high-stakes meeting between Biden and key lawmakers from both parties on Tuesday yielded no breakthrough, but the group agreed to keep trying to avert a default. But on Wednesday, Trump – a frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination – urged otherwise during a live broadcast on CNN. “Republicans out there congressmen, senators, if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re gonna have to do a default,” he said.",

            "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi talks with U.S. President Joe Biden as they arrive for the first working session of the G20 leaders summit in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia, Tuesday, Nov. 15. AP-Yonhap.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House next month, courting an Indo-Pacific leader with whom he has sought stronger ties as the United States looks to blunt China's growing assertiveness in the region.\n\nModi's visit June 22 \"will affirm the deep and close partnership between the United States and India and the warm bonds of family and friendship that link Americans and Indians together,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday in announcing the Indian leader's official state visit.\n\nBiden and Modi will focus on their countries' commitment to a free and secure Indo-Pacific region, as well as on their technology partnerships, including in defense, clean energy and space, she said. They will also discuss common challenges, including climate change, health security and developing the workforce.\n\nIndia's Ministry of External Affairs said the visit will \"underscore the growing importance of the strategic partnership between India and the United States\" \n\n\"This historic visit offers a valuable opportunity for India and the U.S. to further deepen a comprehensive and forward-looking global strategic partnership,\" the Indian government said. U.S.-India relations under Biden have been warm, but also marked by complexity as Biden has sought stronger ties with the world's largest democracy while at the same time looking to counter China's growing economic and military assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Since coming to office, Biden has sought to reinvigorate the Quad, an international partnership with the U.S., Australia, India and Japan. But unlike the other Quad countries and nearly every other major U.S. ally, India has not imposed sanctions on Russia and has offered only limited criticism of its invasion of Ukraine. Russia is India's biggest supplier of military hardware. The partnership first formed during the response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that killed some 230,000 people. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is set to host Biden, Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a Quad Leaders' Summit in Sydney later this month. As Biden worked to unite the world against Russia, India boosted its imports of Russian oil. That allowed India to increase its energy supplies at a discount as its economy struggled to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi greet each other before their meeting in New Delhi, India, Monday, Dec.6, 2021. AP-Yonhap When Modi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September, he offered measured public comments about Russia's actions in Ukraine. \"I know that today's era is not of war,\" Modi told Putin. But Biden has put a premium stronger economic ties with India and other Indo-Pacific nations amid growing competition with China. That's helped soften the differences between the U.S. and India over Russia.\n\n\"So even though, on Russia, Ukraine, and a whole range of other issues around the world, we do have differences in approaches and different views,\" said Richard Rossow, senior adviser and chairperson of U.S.-India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington \"On the threat that we both kind of agree is the major emerging threat ... for the next generations, there's very little daylight in our perception there.\" \n\nLast year, Biden launched a trade deal with India and 11 other Indo-Pacific nations called the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. The White House said the agreement would help those economies work more closely on issues including supply chains, digital trade, clean energy, worker protections and anticorruption efforts.\n\nThe president is likely to face criticism from human rights advocates for inviting Modi on a state visit and for plans plans to celebrate him at a state dinner, which is a high diplomatic honor reserved for close U.S. allies. Press freedom in India has declined in recent years and opponents of Modi's governing Hindu nationalist party have accused it of stifling dissent and introducing divisive policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities.\n\nModi has also been accused of trying to silence critics of his administration's handling of the pandemic. India routinely denies criticism of its human rights record. It has also rejected criticism by foreign governments and rights groups that civil liberties have contracted in the country. Asked about the optics of lavish treatment for Modi, Jean-Pierre said Biden always discusses human rights concerns with his counterparts. She said the U.S.-India relationship is critical. \"This is an important relationship as we speak about the Indo-Pacific, as we talk about how to move forward in that region,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday during a trip with Biden. \"The president believes this is an important relationship that we need to continue and build on.\" Modi had a warm relationship with Biden's immediate predecessor as president, Republican Donald Trump. In 2020, weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic forced much of the world into lockdown, Trump made a two-day visit to India that included a raucous rally at a 110,000-seat cricket stadium. Trump had hosted Modi in the U.S. in 2019, a visit that included a side trip to Houston that drew about 50,000 people, many from the large Indian diaspora in the U.S.\n\nBiden last hosted Modi at the White House in September 2021 for a meeting of leaders of the Quad. India also holds the rotating president of the Group of 20 nations and Biden is expected to attend that summit in New Delhi later this year. Modi is the third foreign leader whom Biden has invited on an official state visit, which includes an expansive arrival ceremony with pomp and pageantry on the White House lawn and a ritzy state dinner with scores of guests from the worlds of politics, business and entertainment. French President Emmanuel Macron visited late last year, followed by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in April. The last time India was so honored was nearly 15 years ago, under then-President Barack Obama in 2009. (AP)",

            "NEW YORK (Reuters) : An unrepentant Donald Trump held firm to past grievances at the first televised town hall of the 2024 US presidential election on Wednesday, making clear from the moment he took the stage that he has little intention of mounting a more disciplined campaign for his third White House bid.\n\nIn a contentious 70-minute broadcast, Trump drew laughter from a New Hampshire audience when he mocked writer E. Jean Carroll’s account of his having sexually abused her, repeated falsehoods about his 2020 election loss, said he would pardon many of his supporters convicted of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, and called his CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins a “nasty person.” \n\nResponding to questions from Collins and members of the audience at Saint Anselm College, Trump made no effort to offer more moderate positions on issues, which political analysts say is key to broadening his appeal to a wider swath of Republicans.\n\nAsked by Collins whether he would acknowledge that he lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, the Republican Trump reasserted unfounded claims that the election was rigged against him, brushing aside her attempts to correct the record.\n\n“That was a rigged election,” Trump said, adding that anyone who thought otherwise was “stupid.” Trump, the front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination, declined to express regret for the deadly attack on the US Capitol when supporters sought to prevent Congress from ratifying the election result, and he repeated his plan to pardon individuals involved if voters return him to the White House in 2024.\n\n“I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can’t say for every single one because a couple of them, probably, they got out of control,” Trump said.\n\nTrump and Collins frequently spoke over each other with Collins challenging a number of the former president’s false claims about both the 2020 election and the attack on Jan. 6 which followed a speech he gave to supporters outside the White House that day.\n\n“I’ve never spoken to a crowd as large as that, and that was because they thought the election was rigged. They were there with love in their heart. That was unbelievable, and it was a beautiful day,” he said.\n\nThe audience of Republicans and independent voters who plan to vote in the Republican primary were generally very supportive of Trump, giving him a standing ovation when he took the stage.\n\nNew Hampshire is an early nominating state that could prove critical in his bid to return to the White House. Responding to Trump’s remarks, the Democratic National Committee said the former president “lied about the 2020 election” for 20 minutes and criticized his characterizing Jan. 6, 2021, as “a beautiful day.” \n\n“This would be disgusting if it wasn’t so dangerous,” DNC spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement. Collins tried to fact-check Trump’s assertions in real time, sometimes leading to the two talking over each other as Trump refused to back down.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal jury found Trump sexually abused Carroll in a department store dressing room in Manhattan in the 1990s, then harmed her reputation by describing her claims as “a hoax” and “a lie.” \n\n“What kind of a woman meets somebody and brings them up and within minutes, you’re playing hanky panky in a dressing room?” Trump said, one of many disparaging comments about Carroll that elicited applause and laughter.\n\nHe called her a “wack job.” After Tuesday’s verdict, Carroll issued a statement saying: “Today, the world finally knows the truth … This victory is not just for me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.” \n\nTrump stood by his remarks in a 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape in which he bragged about grabbing women by the genitals, suggesting stars could have their way with them. The comments were used against Trump at trial.\n\n“And you would like me to take that back. I can’t take it back because it happens to be true. I said, it’s been true for 1 million years, approximately a million years, perhaps a little bit longer than that,” Trump said. “I’m not referring to myself, I’m saying people that are famous, people that are stars.” \n\nTrump, who was absent throughout the two-week trial, was asked by an audience member what he had to say to voters who say it disqualifies him from being president. “Well, there aren’t too many of them because my poll numbers just came out. They went up,” he said.",

            "Donald Trump’s long awaited return to CNN went off the rails almost immediately on Wednesday night, with the former president using the exclusive town hall event to repeatedly lie, mislead viewers, and steamroll CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins—all to the delight of a Trump-adoring crowd.\n\nFrom the very first seconds of the town hall, Trump was lying. When Collins opened the event with a softball—”why should Americans put you back in the White House?”—Trump immediately leaned into his normal election lies. He repeated debunked theories and passionately argued that the election was stolen.\n\nWhen he got his first question from the crowd—will you suspend the “polarizing” talk about election fraud?—a question that had already been answered in the first minute of the town hall, Trump just pushed forward with more disproven election falsehoods.\n\nWhen he was asked about Jan. 6, Trump called the Capitol Police officer who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt “ a thug .” He said he would pardon “a large portion” of the Jan. 6 rioters , blamed the attack on Nancy Pelosi—“Crazy Nancy, as I affectionately call her”—and refused to apologize to his former Vice President for endangering his life. Instead, Trump said Mike Pence “should've put the votes back to the state legislatures.” \n\nWhen Trump was asked about a jury on Tuesday finding him liable for sexual battery and defamation —to the tune of $5 million—Trump repeated many of the same misogynist tropes he based his failed defense on. He called his accuser, E. Jean Carroll, a “ wack job ,” and he repeated his claims that, “unfortunately or fortunately,” celebrities get away with sexual assault.\n\nWhen he was asked about the debt ceiling , Trump openly rooted for economic pain—and suggested that pain was politically the right thing to do. Trump said Republicans should hold out for major spending cuts, even if they would hamper the economy because, \"if I win, they're going to be doing the same thing to me in two years, I guarantee you that,\" Trump said of Democrats. \"They're going to play a very hardball game.\" \n\nWhen Collins called Trump out for saying the debt ceiling shouldn’t be used as “a negotiating wedge,” he acknowledged that he said that when he was president, but followed it up by saying, with a shrug, he could change his tune now “because now I’m not president.” The crowd laughed and applauded.\n\nThroughout the 70-minute town hall, Trump refused to acknowledge reality. When Collins tried to fact-check him, Trump just spoke over her and repeated his falsehoods. When she tried to correct Trump about his election lies, noting that Trump and his supporters lost more than 60 court cases, Trump simply kept lying.\n\n\"They found millions of votes on camera, on government cameras, where they were stuffing ballot boxes,” Trump falsely claimed.\n\nCollins repeatedly tried to correct the record, but Trump just kept forging ahead with more lies. When he said the “government cameras” showed “people going to 28 different voting booths”—something that never happened—Collins tried to correct him to no avail.\n\nHalfway through the town hall, CNN staffers were acknowledging the event was a disaster for the truth.\n\n“This is so bad,” one of CNN’s on-air personalities told The Daily Beast before the first commercial break. \"I was cautiously optimistic despite the criticism...it is awful. It's a Trump infomercial. We're going to get crushed.\" \"One of the worst hours I've ever seen on our air,” another CNN staffer told The Daily Beast.\n\nAfter the town hall, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung summed up the situation by victoriously tweeting a clip from the movie “Captain Phillips,” in which Somali pirates take over a large container ship. Trump’s game plan seemed to be a familiar one: spew so many lies that fact-checking him would be impossible. Before Collins could correct him on one lie, he was talking over her and telling another. In a characteristic exchange, Trump repeatedly claimed he built a complete wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. “I did finish the wall,” Trump said. “I built a wall. I built hundreds of miles of wall. And I finished it, and I said we have to build some more.” Trump then claimed a “rigged election” got in the way of him completing the entire wall. “The election was not rigged, Mr. President, you can’t keep saying that all night long,” Collins interjected. Collins then corrected Trump that his administration had only built 52 miles of wall, to which Trump just falsely claimed that he built “hundreds of miles of wall” that would have been finished in three weeks. And when Collins interjected again to clarify that Trump had only built 52 miles of new wall, Trump talked over her and dismissed her. \"They are the party of disinformation. This is what she does,” Trump said, to more applause from the Trump-friendly crowd.\n\nCollins tried throughout the entirety of the town hall to combat Trump’s lies, interjecting as much as she could to correct the former president. But the very format of the event—a town hall question and answer, with voters who seemed to cherish every word out of Trump’s mouth—was ill-suited for an even playing field with the truth. Trump was simply free to talk over Collins, keep repeating lies, and then welcome the applause from a crowd composed mostly of GOP voters. One of the former president’s most meandering answers was on gun control, where he gave a woefully inaccurate summary of gun control in Brazil, where the government instituted a buy-back program in March that he failed to mention.\n\nEven given the opportunity to tout his own administration’s limited action on gun violence, Trump brushed aside his executive order banning bump stocks as NRA-approved, and said the device key to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting that left 60 people dead and more than 400 wounded was a “very unimportant thing.” “The NRA, I went with them, they said they don’t mean anything. All they do is teach you to shoot inaccurately,” he said. On abortion, Trump said he was “honored” to have appointed the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade , calling the decision an asset for the GOP. “And because of what I’ve done, we have a great negotiating ability,” Trump said. When asked by Collins what he meant by that, Trump briefly alluded to a range of abortion bans starting at six weeks. Collins offered Trump a chance to specify whether he would support a federal abortion ban, but he punted.\n\n“I'm looking at a solution that's going to work,” Trump said. “Very complex issue for the country. You have people on both sides of an issue, but we are now in a very strong position. Pro-life people are in a strong position to make a deal that's going to be good and going to be satisfactory for them. If you weren't able to get rid of—you wouldn't be having a discussion if you weren't able to get rid of Roe v. Wade. ” Trump also defended his administration’s child separation policy, and argued cities wouldn’t be “swamped” with migrants if the Biden administration continued the practice decried by the UN’s human rights chief . When asked if he would continue to give weapons and other military assistance to Ukraine, Trump took the opportunity to relitigate his first impeachment and delayed answering the question. He wouldn’t say whether he wanted Ukraine or Russia to win the war. “I don't think in terms of winning and losing,” he said. Collins continued pressing back against Trump across a variety of false claims, but the former president largely talked over her, at one point calling her “a nasty person.” Trump operatives were declaring victory before the town hall was even over, with one source close to the former president saying he “dominates every room he's in.” \n\n“He's been on TV since before Kaitlan was born,” this source said. The Trump campaign went into the night looking for a viral moment, and other longtime Trump observers told The Daily Beast they saw parallels going into the event with Trump’s first debate in Aug. 2015, when former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly was a moderator and served as a certain foil for Trump. One topic Trump didn’t mention was Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis , except for a glancing shot when Trump noted that he’s leading in the polls “by a lot.” To end the night, Collins asked Trump if he would commit to supporting the results of the 2024 election. “If it’s an honest election, correct, I will,” Trump said. As Collins signed off, Trump could be seen shaking her hand and telling her she did a nice job, as he gave a thumbs up to the crowd.

            "Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasted CNN ’s controversial Donald Trump town hall as “shameful” as the former president used the live event to push “rigged” election lies and baseless conspiracy theories. “CNN should be ashamed of themselves. They have lost total control of this ‘town hall’ to again be manipulated into platforming election disinformation, defenses of Jan 6th, and a public attack on a sexual abuse victim,” the Democratic lawmaker from New York tweeted. “The audience is cheering him on and laughing at the host.\n\nThis falls squarely on CNN. Everyone here saw exactly what was going to happen. “Instead they put a sexual abuse victim in harm’s way for views. This was a choice to platform lies about the election & Jan 6th w/ no plan but to have their moderator interrupted without consequence.” \n\nThe event took place in front of an audience of 400 Republican and GOP-leaning independent voters in New Hampshire on Wednesday night. Ms Ocasio-Cortez then went on MSNBC where she criticised CNN for allowing Mr Trump to criticise the $5m E Jean Carroll sexual abuse verdict against him. “I know you said earlier that you will not comment on the platforming of such atrocious disinformation, but I would,” she said on air. “I think it was a profoundly irresponsible decision. I don’t think I would be doing my job if I did not say that what we saw tonight was a series of extremely irresponsible decisions that put a sexual abuse victim at risk, that put that person at risk in front of a national audience and I could not have disagreed with it more. It was shameful.”",

        content:
            "Donald Trump has wrapped up a controversial town hall event hosted by CNN by saying he would only accept the results of the 2024 election if he felt they were “honest”. The town hall in New Hampshire comes just one day after Mr Trump was found liable of sexually abusing and defaming writer E Jean Carroll by a jury.\n\nMr Trump used the platform afforded to him by the news network to mock the woman he has been ordered to pay $5m. While the town hall was condemned immediately after being announced last week, fury grew even stronger following Tuesday’s verdict with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Michael Fanone criticising the event — the former tweeting on the night that CNN should be “ashamed”.\n\nIn a blizzard of falsehoods, Mr Trump barrelled through the hour-long broadcast at times talking over moderator Kaitlan Collins’s facts checks and orders to answer the question asked. Mr Trump refused to say he wants Ukraine to win the war against Russia, would not accept the result of the 2020 election, and said he would consider pardoning January 6 rioters. When more forcefully challenged by Collins about taking classified documents, he called her a “nasty person”.",

            "Former president said ‘cunning’ Putin made ‘tremendous mistake’ with bloody invasion",

            "Donald Trump has been blasted for refusing to say he supported Ukraine to win its bloody war with Russia and was branded “Putin’s puppet” by Chris Christie. The one-term president was repeatedly asked by CNN host Kaitlan Collins if he backed Ukraine in its 15-month conflict with Vladimir Putin ’s forces, and repeatedly dodged the question. “Donald Trump refused to say tonight that he wanted Ukraine to win the war with Russia. More proof that he continues to be Putin’s puppet,” the former Republican candidate for president tweeted.\n\nCollins asked Mr Trump during the town hall from New Hampshire to say on the record that he supported Ukraine. “I don’t think in terms of winning and losing, I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people and breaking down this country,” he told Collins. She then asked him again if he wanted Ukraine or Russia to win the conflict. “I want everyone to stop dying. They are dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying,” he replied. Mr Trump also repeated his bogus claim that it would take him one day in the Oval Office to end the conflict.\n\n“I’ll have that done in 24 hours, you need the power of the presidency to do it.” And he added: “You know what, I will say this, I want Europe to put up more money. They should equalise, they have plenty of money.” And he boasted that the conflict would never even have happened if he had remained in office. “If I were president this never would have happened and even the Democrats recognise that. Putin knew it would never have happened and his pipeline would never have happened, a lot of things would never have happened,” he said. “All those dead people, both Russian and Ukrainian, would not be dead today, and all those cities that are blown up and disintegrated to the ground would not have happened.” Mr Trump also tried to claim that he had “a very good relationship” with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nMr Trump was impeached for the first time over a call in which he tried to get Mr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden in return for weapons. “I have a very good relationship with President Zelensky, because as you know he backed me up with phoney impeachment hoax number one when he said the president did nothing wrong. I was totally exonerated, by the way, a total waste of time and money,” said Mr Trump. Collins reminded viewers that the former president had been impeached by Congress.\n\nCollins then asked Mr Trump if he still had “tremendous respect” for Vladimir Putin, as he claimed while president. “He made a tremendous mistake. He is a smart guy...they want you to say he is a stupid person, okay, he is not a stupid person, he is very smart and cunning and Putin made a bad mistake in my opinion. “His mistake was going in. He would never have gone in if I was president, we used to talk about it too.” And he refused to answer if he believed Mr Putin is a war criminal for his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“I think it’s something that should not be discussed now, it should be discussed later,” Mr Trump said, suggesting it would make ending the conflict even more difficult. “If you say he’s a war criminal it’s going to be a lot tougher to make a deal to make this thing stopped. If he’s going to be a war criminal, people are going to grab him and execute him, he’s going to fight a lot harder than he’s fighting under the other circumstance. That’s something to be discussed at a later day.”",

            "Former President Donald Trump called Kaitlin Collins a “nasty person” during a tense exchange over classified documents during CNN’s New Hampshire town hall . During a combative back-and-forth over Mr Trump retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Mr Trump and Ms Collins spoke over each other for several moments.\n\n“Do you mind?” Mr Trump said. “I would like for you to answer the question. That’s why I asked it,” Ms Collins said. “You’re a nasty person, I’ll tell ya,” Mr Trump responded, which elicited applause from the GOP-leaning audience. “Can you answer why you held on to the documents?” Collins asked again. “It’s very simple. I was negotiating and I was talking to Nara (National Archives and Records Administration),” he began, arguing why he believed he was right to have held onto documents the government was looking for.\n\nCollins was unflinching and continued to push back on Mr Trump’s false interpretation of the Presidential Records Act. Moments later after another contentious back-and-forth between the two over election interference in Georgia, Mr Trump said he would only accept the results of the 2024 election if he thought they were “honest”.\n\nTheir allotted time was up and Collins closed out the town hall. The former president shook her hand and told her she had done a good job. Collins joins the roster of women in public life who he has called “nasty” after they challenge him in some way: Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen... there are were at least 14 incidents documented by The Washington Post as of August 2019.",

            "Former President Donald Trump doubled down on his support for his fans who attacked the US Capitol, during a contentious C NN town hall on Wednesday where Mr Trump steamrolled moderator Kaitlan Collins and repeated numerous falsehoods.\n\nDuring Wednesday night’s broadcast, the president enjoyed a friendly audience that was receptive to both his continued lies about fraud in the 2020 election as well as his vow to pardon some of the January 6 rioters prosecuted by the Justice Department. And he spoke glowingly about the day when his supporters stormed the steps of American democracy and fought with police while screaming threats, insults, and slurs. “It was a beautiful day,” he said, adding that his fans “were there with love in their hearts” when they left dozens of police officers with injuries and chanted death threats targeting lawmakers as they marched through the Capitol.\n\nThe former president talked over Collins at numerous points, aided by his cheering fans in the crowd, and repeated lie after lie about supposed instances of fraud in the 2020 election before moving on to the day of the attack on Congress itself. Speaking of the attack, the former president minimised the violence as well as the danger that lawmakers inside faced, including his own vice president who Mr Trump said was never really threatened.\n\nHe would even falsely accuse the police officer who killed rioter Ashli Babbitt, as she attempted to breach the House floor with lawmakers still inside, of “bragging” about the shooting on TV. Above all else, it was classic Donald Trump: Unabashed support for anyone willing to go to the mat for him and his political movement, and an absolute refusal to accept facts that contradict his narrative. It was also, to the lament of many journalists online, classic CNN circa 2016: Half-hearted attempts at corrections for a smattering of the ex-president’s falsehoods undermined by the networks various choices — including Collins’ own to move on to other topics quickly after issuing one of those various editorial notes.\n\nMr Trump remains the leading candidate for the 2024 GOP nomination even as he continues to face a criminal investigation in Georgia into his and his legal team’s conduct and their efforts to interfere in Georgia’s election results; the Department of Justice also continues to investigate and mull potential charges for members of Mr Trump’s inner circle including the former president himself related to the attack on the Capitol. Hundreds of other Americans have already been charged and in many cases convicted for their roles in the brutal assault.",

            "President Joe Biden went after his old 2020 rival on Wednesday as Donald Trump attempted to make his case for a third presidential bid at a CNN town hall.\n\nMr Biden joined with others commenting on the ex-president’s combative performance, and asked whether Americans were really ready for another four years with a brash mudslinger in the White House. His remark came as Mr Trump mocked his CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins as a “nasty” person while spreading his usual lies about the 2020 election and his efforts to overturn the results. “It’s simple, folks.\n\nDo you want four more years of that?” Mr Biden asked. Mr Biden announced his own re-election campaign last month; if elected to serve another four years in office, he would be 86 by the time his term ended, thus making him the oldest president to ever serve. Polls of the president’s approval rating have shown his base of supporters shrinking over the past several months, and in some Mr Biden trails his potential 2024 GOP challengers Donald Trump or Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by several percentage points.\n\nStill, the president remains adamant that he is the best choice for his party’s nominee in 2024 even as wide swaths of the Democratic Party, according to polling, would prefer that he step aside.\n\nMr Biden has pointed to his party’s successful defence of the Senate in last year’s midterm elections as evidence of his own political strength, though the actual dynamics of the congressional and statewide contests are thought to have been affected more by the constant claims of election fraud by Trump-backed candidates and the recent overturn of Roe vs Wade by the Supreme Court. Mr Trump spent the bulk of his time at the CNN town hall on Wednesday repeating those same lies and refusing to take accountability for the attack on the US Capitol, even falsely claiming to have offered thousands of troops when in fact no order to deploy was issued.",
